Nostr IoT Dashboard provides a user interface for discovering and controlling IoT devices through the Nostr protocol using Data Vending Machine (DVM) standards.

This extension enables users to interact with IoT devices that advertise their capabilities on Nostr relays, supporting Lightning Network payments for paid device functions.

Key features include:

- **Device Discovery**: Automatically finds IoT devices from your Nostr follow list that advertise DVM capabilities (kind 31990 events)
- **Real-time Control**: Execute device capabilities through Nostr DVM requests (kind 5107) and receive responses (kind 6107)
- **Lightning Integration**: Seamless payment handling for paid IoT functions with QR code invoice display
- **Multi-relay Support**: Connects to multiple Nostr relays for improved reliability and device discovery
- **User Authentication**: Supports both Nostr browser extensions and manual private key input for device control

Perfect for managing smart home devices, sensors, and other IoT equipment that implement the Nostr DVM protocol for decentralized device communication.
